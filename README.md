- API from exisiting Models
Here are a few existing models that are commonly used to detect obscene data on the internet:

    Yahoo's Open NSFW: This is an open-source deep learning model developed by Yahoo's moderation team. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as safe or not safe for work (NSFW). It is primarily focused on identifying explicit or pornographic content in images.

    Google's Perspective API: Developed by Google's Jigsaw, Perspective API is an API that uses machine learning models to analyze and detect various types of toxic and offensive content, including obscenity, hate speech, and harassment. It provides a text-based moderation solution.

    Sightengine: Sightengine is an AI-based content moderation platform that offers various models to detect and filter inappropriate content. It utilizes computer vision algorithms to analyze images and video frames for explicit or offensive material.

    Clarifai: Clarifai is an AI platform that provides visual recognition models capable of detecting explicit or NSFW content in images and videos. It offers pre-trained models that can be integrated into applications for content moderation.

    Microsoft Content Moderator: Microsoft Content Moderator is a cloud-based service that combines machine learning models and human review to detect and filter out explicit, adult, or otherwise inappropriate content. It offers image moderation, text moderation, and video moderation capabilities.

These are just a few examples of the existing models and services available for detecting obscene data on the internet. Different platforms and companies may have their own proprietary models and solutions tailored for content moderation purposes.

## Clarifai API

To use Clarifai for detecting obscenity in images, you can follow these general steps:

1. Sign up and create an account: Visit the Clarifai website (https://www.clarifai.com/) and sign up for an account. Once you have created an account, you'll have access to the Clarifai API.

2. Get your API credentials: After signing up, you will need to obtain your API credentials, specifically the API key. This key will be used to authenticate your requests to the Clarifai API.

3. Install the Clarifai Python library: If you're using Python, you can install the Clarifai Python library by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   pip install clarifai
   ```

4. Import the necessary modules: In your Python code, import the required modules from the Clarifai library. For obscenity detection, you will mainly need the `ClarifaiApp` and `Model` classes.

5. Initialize the Clarifai application: Create an instance of the `ClarifaiApp` class by passing your API key as a parameter. This will allow you to authenticate your requests.

6. Load the NSFW model: Use the `Model` class to load the NSFW (Not Safe For Work) model. This model is specifically trained to identify explicit or NSFW content in images.

7. Pass images for analysis: Provide the images you want to analyze to the NSFW model. You can pass either URLs or local file paths of the images.

8. Retrieve the results: After analyzing the images, you will receive the results from the NSFW model. The results will indicate the probability of the image containing explicit content.

Here's a sample code snippet that demonstrates the basic usage of Clarifai for obscenity detection:

```python
from clarifai import ClarifaiApp

# Initialize Clarifai app with your API key
app = ClarifaiApp(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

# Load the NSFW model
model = app.models.get('nsfw-v1.0')

# Pass images for analysis (replace 'image_url' with your own image URL)
image_url = 'https://example.com/image.jpg'
response = model.predict_by_url(url=image_url)

# Retrieve the outputs containing the NSFW probability
outputs = response['outputs']
if outputs and len(outputs) > 0:
    nsfw_probability = outputs[0]['data']['concepts'][0]['value']
    print("NSFW probability:", nsfw_probability)
```

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual Clarifai API key and provide the appropriate image URL or local file path.

Remember to review the Clarifai documentation and API reference for more advanced usage and customization options: https://docs.clarifai.com/
